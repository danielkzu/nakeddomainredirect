        </div>
        <div>
            We created an EC2 machine instance exclusively for this purpose. It's not being used for anything other than naked 
            domain redirects. It's an EC2 Micro instance, using a fixed elastic IP, based on the Amazon provided <a href="http://kzu.to/Tvifso">AMI with Windows 
            Server 2008 R2 and IIS</a>, running on the US-West Oregon region, us-west-2a availability zone. SQL Server Express services have been disabled.
            <p>
                <a href="http://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite">IIS Rewrite Module 2.0</a> was installed and the default web site's whole 
                <a href="web.config">configuration file</a> is available for inspection. Note how we cleared all registered handlers and left just the rewrite 
                one, for maximum speed.
            </p>
            <strong>Contingency Plans</strong>
            <p>We have created an AMI and corresponding EC2 instances in the other two availability zones within the region, which are in stand-by.
                In the event of a failure in the current availability zone, we will just quickly switch the elastic IP to one of those to resume 
                the service. None of the outages Amazon had has ever spanned multiple availability zones within a region, so service disruption 
                will be minimal even in the presence of severe failures in Amazon infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p>Elastic IPs can't be assigned across regions, however. A full region failure would require a change in your A record that points to it, 
                to a new elastic IP in a new region. The process of resuming the service in another region is equally fast, save for the DNS update replication.
            </p>
            <strong>Monitoring</strong>
            <p>We use the exact same monitoring tools explained in the <a href="index.html">introduction</a>, with the addition of 
                an <a href="http://www.ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> recipe that turns the 
                <a href="http://status.aws.amazon.com/rss/ec2-us-west-2.rss">EC2 availability zone status feed</a> news into emails for us.
